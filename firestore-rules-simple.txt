SIMPLE FIRESTORE RULES FOR TESTING
===================================

Try these VERY PERMISSIVE rules first to test if data works:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // TEMPORARY: Allow all read/write for testing
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

⚠️  WARNING: These rules allow ANYONE to read/write ALL data.
Only use for testing, then switch to secure rules!

STEPS:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules
2. Replace ALL existing rules with the above
3. Click "Publish"
4. Wait 30 seconds for propagation
5. Test migration again

If this works, we know it's a rules issue and can create proper secure rules.
