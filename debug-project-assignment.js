/*
 * Debug script to test project assignment issue
 * 
 * Steps to test:
 * 1. Create admin and client accounts
 * 2. Admin creates project assigned to client
 * 3. Client logs in and checks if project is visible
 * 
 * Expected behavior:
 * - Project should be stored with assignedTo = client.uid
 * - Client should be able to query where('assignedTo', '==', client.uid)
 * - Project should appear in client's dashboard

üîç DEBUG PROJECT ASSIGNMENT ISSUE

1. First, create project as admin:
   - Login as admin
   - Create project "test project new"
   - Assign to christopher.igbojekwe@gmail.com
   - Check console logs for project creation

2. Then, login as client:
   - Login as christopher.igbojekwe@gmail.com
   - Check console logs for:
     - User info (uid, email, role)
     - Project fetching attempt
     - Query results

3. Look for mismatches:
   - Is assignedTo field using email instead of uid?
   - Is user.uid correct?
   - Are there any Firebase permissions issues?

Key things to check:
- Project document assignedTo field should match user.uid
- User document should have correct uid (not email)
- Firebase rules should allow user to read their assigned projects
