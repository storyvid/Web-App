FIRESTORE SECURITY RULES FIX
============================

The error "Missing or insufficient permissions" means your Firestore security rules 
are blocking read/write operations.

ðŸ”§ IMMEDIATE FIX - Update your Firestore Rules:

1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project (storyvid-d1792)
3. Go to Firestore Database â†’ Rules
4. Replace your current rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write projects
    match /projects/{projectId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write notifications
    match /notifications/{notificationId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write activities
    match /activities/{activityId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow system documents (for migration tracking)
    match /system/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow test documents (for debugging)
    match /test/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow companies documents
    match /companies/{companyId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click "Publish" to apply the rules

ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: These rules allow any authenticated user to read/write data.
In production, you'll want more restrictive rules that check user roles and ownership.

ðŸ“‹ AFTER UPDATING RULES:

1. Go back to http://localhost:3000/debug
2. Run "Run Force Migration" again
3. Then test "Check Firestore Data"
4. If successful, login as client@test.com and check dashboard

The dummy data should now populate correctly!
