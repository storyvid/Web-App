# Service Card Alignment Test

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Card Width & Alignment
- Added `width: '100%'` and `maxWidth: '100%'` to ensure consistent card widths
- Added `alignItems: 'stretch'` to Grid container
- Added `display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column'` to Grid items

### 2. Consistent Heights
- Increased `minHeight` to `320px` for better content spacing
- Added `minHeight: '3.2rem'` for service names (handles 2-line names)
- Added `minHeight: '4.8rem'` for descriptions (consistent spacing)

### 3. Content Layout
- Added consistent `padding: 3` to all CardContent
- Override MUI default bottom padding for better alignment
- Proper flex layout with `flex: 1` for descriptions

## Test Instructions

1. **Go to Services Page**
   - Navigate to `/services-test`
   - Login as admin (to see debug info)
   - Go to Services page

2. **Visual Verification**
   - All 6 cards should be perfectly aligned
   - Same width across all breakpoints (desktop/tablet/mobile)
   - Same height regardless of content length
   - Clean grid alignment with consistent spacing

3. **Responsive Test**
   - Desktop (md): 3 cards per row
   - Tablet (sm): 2 cards per row  
   - Mobile (xs): 1 card per row
   - All should maintain consistent alignment

4. **Content Verification**
   - "Customer Testimonials" (longest name) aligns with others
   - All descriptions align at same baseline
   - All buttons align at bottom of cards

## Expected Results
- Perfect grid alignment with no width variations
- Consistent card heights (320px minimum)
- Professional, uniform appearance
- Proper responsive behavior across devices

## Technical Changes Made

### ServiceCard.js:
```jsx
<Card sx={{ 
  width: '100%',
  height: '100%', 
  minHeight: 320,
  maxWidth: '100%'
}}>

<Typography sx={{ 
  minHeight: '3.2rem' // Service names
}}>

<Typography sx={{ 
  minHeight: '4.8rem' // Descriptions  
}}>
```

### ServicesContent.js:
```jsx
<Grid container spacing={3} sx={{ 
  alignItems: 'stretch' 
}}>
  <Grid item sx={{ 
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'column' 
  }}>
```

All cards should now be perfectly aligned! ðŸŽ¯
