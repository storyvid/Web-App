# Week 3 Phase 1 High-Level Summary

## What We Will Achieve

### Core Deliverables (Days 1-2)

#### 1. Enhanced Dashboard
- **Milestone Indicators**: Project cards will show next milestone due dates and status
- **File Activity**: Recent upload counts and file status indicators on project cards
- **Quick Stats Enhancement**: Add "Pending Approvals" and "Upcoming Deadlines" cards
- **Navigation Links**: "View All Projects" button to bridge to Projects List page

#### 2. Projects List Page (New)
- **Basic Layout**: Grid and table view toggle functionality
- **Essential Filtering**: Filter by project status, team member, and date range
- **Search Capability**: Global search across project names and descriptions
- **Project Entries**: Cards/rows showing thumbnail, name, status badge, progress %, and team avatars
- **Navigation Flow**: Click project entry → Navigate to Project Detail page

#### 3. Project Detail Page Foundation
- **Header Structure**: Project title, description, overall progress bar, team avatars, key dates
- **Tabbed Interface**: 5-tab shell (Overview, Milestones, Files, Activity, Team)
- **Tab 1 - Overview**: Basic project information and placeholder for timeline
- **Navigation Integration**: Breadcrumbs and back-to-projects functionality

### Key Navigation Flow Established

- ❌ Advanced filtering and sorting options
- ❌ Activity feeds and timeline visualizations
- ❌ Mobile-specific optimizations

## Success Criteria for Phase 1

1. **Seamless Navigation**: Users can flow from Dashboard → Projects List → Project Detail without confusion
2. **Visual Consistency**: All new pages match existing dashboard design language
3. **Performance**: All pages load in under 2 seconds
4. **Responsive Foundation**: Basic responsive layout works on desktop and tablet
5. **Data Integration**: Real project data populates all views correctly

## Technical Foundation Established

- **Routing Structure**: React Router paths for all new pages
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable components for project cards and navigation
- **State Management**: Basic state handling for filters and view toggles
- **API Integration**: Service layer calls for project data retrieval
- **UI Components**: Material-UI based components matching dashboard theme

## Phase 1 Outcome
By the end of Phase 1, users will have a complete project browsing experience with intuitive navigation between dashboard overview, comprehensive project list, and detailed project views. This creates the essential foundation for milestone and file management features in subsequent phases.
